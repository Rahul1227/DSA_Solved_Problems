Problem statement
Given a string ‘S’ find whether the given string is periodic or not.

A string is said to be periodic if it repeats itself after a certain number of characters and the period of repetition is less than the size of the string.

For example: Let ‘S’ be “ababab” we can clearly see that this string is periodic as ‘ab’ is repeated 3 times to make the string ‘S’.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1<= S.length<=10^5

Where 'S.length' denotes the length of string ‘S’.
The given string consists of lowercase English alphabets only.

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
3
xxxxxx
aabbaaabba
abcba
Sample Output 1:
True
True
False      
Explanation of sample input 1 :
Test Case 1:
In the first test case, we can clearly see that the string has a repeating string ‘x’ 6 times. So we return true

Test Case 2:

In the second test case, we can see that the string ‘aabba’ repeats twice to form the given string. Hence we return true,

Test Case 3:

In the third test case, we can see that there is no string which repeats itself to form the given string, hence we return false.
Sample Input 2:
2
vwvnqpnchqik
ubzumubzumubzumubzum
Sample Output 2:
False
True
