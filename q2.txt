Problem statement
Given a sequence of queries of insertion and getProduct, you need to create an array using queries of type-0 and answer queries of type-1.

In each query, the input is of two types :

0 X: insert element ‘X’ at the end array.

1 K: find the product of the last 'K' elements in the array

Note:

For the query of type 1, you can assume that the array has at least k values. And at any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 3
0 <= X <= 100
0 <= QUERIES <=5000
1 <= K <= 5000

Where X denotes the value to be stored in the array.

Time limit: 1 sec.
Sample Input 1:
1
10
0 3
0 0
0 2
0 5
0 4
1 2
1 3
1 4
0 8
1 2
Sample Output 1:
20 40 0 32
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
After the first 5 insertions, the array will be [3 0 2 5 4]

Product with k=2 is 5*4 = 20
Product with k=3 is 2*5*4 = 40
Product with k=4 is 0*2*5*4 = 0

Insert 8 : [ 3 0 2 5 4 8]
Product with k=2 is 4*8 = 32
Sample Input 2:
1
12
0 24
1 1
0 58
0 2
1 3
0 73
1 3
0 66
0 0
1 4
0 8
1 7
Sample Output 2:
